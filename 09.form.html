    *
    * web forms are represented by the <form> element in HTML and by the HTMLFormElement type in JS. HTMLFormElement inherite from HTMLElement. and also has more properties and methods;
    * acceptCharset - the character sets that the server can process, equivalent to the HTML accept-character attribut.
    * action - the url to send the request to, equivalent to the HTML action attribute.
    * enctype - the encoding type of the request,
    * length - the number of controls in the form
    * method - the type of HTTP request to send, typically get or post
    * name - the name of the form
    * reset() - resets all form fields to their default values
    * target - the name of the window to use for sending the request and receiving the response

    * to contain the activation object from createComparisonFunction and the global variable object, this gives the anonymous function access to all of the variables from createComparisonFunction().
    * but activation object from createComparisonFunction() cannot be destroyed once the function finishes executing, because a reference still exists in the anonymous function's scope chain.
    * after createComparisonFunction() completes the scope chain for its execution context is destroyed, but its activation object will remain in memory until the anonymous function is destroyed.

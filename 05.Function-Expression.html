    * this code defines a function named compare() that is called in the global execution context. when compare() is called for the first time, a new activation object is created that contains arguments,
    * val1 and val2. the global execution context's variable object is next in the compare() execution context's scope chain, which contains this, result and compare.
    *
    * behind the scene, an object represents the variables in each execution context. the global context's variable object always exists, whereas local context variable objects, such as the one for compare
    * exist only while the function is being executed. when compare() is defined, its scope chain is created, preloaded with the global variable object, and saved to the internal [[Scope]] property.
    * after the function is called, an execution context is created and its scope chain is built up by copying the object in the function's [[Scope]] property. after that an activation object (which also
    * acts as a variable object) is created and push to the front of the context's scope chain. here that means the compare() function's execution context has two variable objects in its scope chain:
    * the local activation object and global variable object. note that the scope chain is essentially a list of pointers to variable objects and does not physically contain the objects.
    *
    * whenever a variable is acessed inside a function, the scope chain is searched for a variable with the given name. once the function has completed, the local avtivation object is destroyed, leaving
    * only the global scope in memory,
    *
    * a function that is defined inside another function adds the containing function's activation object into its scope chain, so in createComparisonFunction(), the anonymous function's scope chain
    * actually contains a reference to the activation object for createComparisonFunction(), when the anonymous function is returned from createComparisonFunction(), its scope chain has been initialized
    * to contain the activation object from createComparisonFunction and the global variable object, this gives the anonymous function access to all of the variables from createComparisonFunction().
    * but activation object from createComparisonFunction() cannot be destroyed once the function finishes executing, because a reference still exists in the anonymous function's scope chain.
    * after createComparisonFunction() completes the scope chain for its execution context is destroyed, but its activation object will remain in memory until the anonymous function is destroyed.

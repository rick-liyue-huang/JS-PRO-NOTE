    * a variable is literally just a name for a particular value at a particular time, and a variable's value and data type can change
    * during the lifetime of a script. it contains two types of data: primitive value and reference value. Primitive values are simple
    * atomic pieces of data, while reference values are object that may be made of multiple values.
    *
    * five primitive values: null, undefined, string, boolean, number. these values are accessible by value, because you are manipulated
    * the actual value stored in the variable.
    * reference values are objects stored in memory, JS does not permit direct access of memory locations. so direct manipulation of the
    * object's memory space is not allowed. when we manipulate an object, you're really working on a reference to that object rather than
    * the actual object itself. so we can say they are accessed by reference.
    *
    * one big difference is that --
    * we can add, change or delete properties and methods on one reference value at any time.
    * only reference values can have properties defined dynamically for later use.

    * is the actual value, while for reference values, the "value" is the location "reference". so they both refer to the same object.

    * execution context -- context, is of the utmost importance in JS.
    * each execution context has an associated variable object upon which all of its defined variables and functions exist.
    * this object is not accessible by code but is used behind the scenes to handle data.
    *
    * all global variables and functions are created as properties and methods on the window object.
    * when an execution context has executed all of its code, it is destroyed, taking with it all of the variables and functions
    * defined within it. the global context is not destroyed until the application exits, such as when a web page is closed or
    * a web browser is shut down.
    *
    * each function call has its own execution context. whenever code execution flows into a function, the function's context is pushed
    * onto a context stack. after the function has finished executing, the stack is popped, return control to the previously executing context.
    * the facility controls execution flow throughout an JS program.
    *
    * when code is executed in a context, a scope chain of variable objects created. the front of the scope chain is always the variable
    * object of the context whose code is executing.
    *
    * if the context is a function, then the activation object is used as the variable object. an activation object starts with a single defined
    * variable called arguments. the next variable object in the chain is from the containing context, and the next after that is from the
    * next containing context. this pattern continues until the global context is reached. the global context's variable object is always
    * the last of the scope chain.

    *  understanding event flow, working with event handler, examining the different types of events
    *
    *  JS's interaction with HTML is handler through events.
    *
    *  event flow --
    *  describes the order in which events are received on the page, and the IE and netscape development teams came up with an
    *  almost exactly opposite concept of event flow.
    *  IE would support an event bubbling flow
    *  Netscape would support an event capturing flow
    * */

    /*
    * IE event flow is called event bubbling, because an event is said to start at the most specific element, and then flow upward
    * toward the least specific node. div -> body -> html -> document for div element
    *
    * all modern browsers support event bubbling, IE9, Firefox and safari, chrome continue event bubbling up to the window object
    * */

    /*
    * Event capturing --
    * the theory of event capturing is that the least specific node should receive the event first and the most specific node
    * should receive the event last.
    *
    * document -> html -> body -> div for event capturing
